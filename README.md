### Installing the system

* Copy config/bridgembed.yml.example to config/bridgembed.yml and set the configurations
* Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and configure your database
* Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
* Run `rake db:migrate`
* Start the server

### Using the system

You can render a worksheet as a milestone by calling `http://yourhostname/medias/embed/milestone/<worksheet title>`.
You can embed a worksheet by adding a script tag like `<script src="http://yourhostname/medias/embed/milestone/<worksheet title>.js"></script>` to your HTML page. You can do the same to single links by just replacing `milestone` by `link` above, and use the link SHA1 hash instead of the milestone title.

### Developing the Sass theme with the separate Sass (node) environment

* Install the Bridge-embed-ui dependences in *package.json* with `npm install` â€” this gives you gulp and browsersync.
* At the top level of the sass theme, there is a central Sass file that `@imports` other sass files.
* Some of these Sass files are managed with Bower (which is added to the path in the gulpfile).
* The bower libraries are not in version control, you must first install them with `bundle exec rake bower:install` (or just `bower install`).
* Make sure you run the rails app (per above) and hit the route to trigger the cached embed codes. You should see the cached html filed like this: `public/cache/first_1424035717.html`
* Run `gulp` to start watching the Sass files.
* Navigate directly to the cached file like this: (exact path depends on your timestamped cache): `http://localhost:3000/cache/first_1424035717.html`
* When the page loads you should see confirmation that browser sync loaded in the browser. When you save your sass file it should injet the new CSS without a full page load. 
* Open the "external" link on your phones and tablets on the same network.
* (TODO: Automatically open the correct URL for testing.)

### Running the tests

* Run `bundle exec rake test`
