/// Flex item
///
/// The flex item is the building block of the flex layout.
///
/// - Flex grow - This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up. If all items have flex-grow set to 1, every child will set to an equal size inside the container. If you were to give one of the children a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much space as the others.
/// - Flex shrink — This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
/// - Flex basis — This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. The main-size value makes it match the width or height, depending on which is relevant based on the flex-direction.
///  @see https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
